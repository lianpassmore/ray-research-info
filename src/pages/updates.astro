					Sessions with Ray can bring up things that sit close to the heart. That's normal — it means you're doing real work. But if you ever want to debrief, talk something through, or just hear a human voice after a session, the researcher is available for a call <strong>at any time</strong> during the pilot.

				<p class="body-text text-sm mb-3">
					Your engagement with Ray has completely exceeded expectations — you've used it so much that we're running low on the credits that power each session. That's a problem we're genuinely happy to have. To make sure everyone gets to complete their final review, the pilot is winding up a little earlier than planned.

					<p class="body-text text-sm">Next time you log in, just tell Ray you need to do your <strong>final review</strong> — he'll know what you mean. It takes about 15 minutes and it's the single most important piece of this research. Please try to do this in the next couple of days.</p>

				<p class="font-bold mb-2">LLM switched from Claude Haiku 4.5 to Gemini Flash 2.5</p>
				<p class="body-text text-sm">
					We realised that with Claude Haiku 4.5 we were going to run out of credits well before the two-week mark. To make sure everyone gets enough time with Ray, we've switched the underlying model to Gemini Flash 2.5, which gives us significantly more minutes. This may affect Ray's voice and performance at times — if you notice anything odd, please let the researcher know. Better to make this change now while the pilot is still early.

				<p class="font-bold mb-2">Fix: Ray no longer says "pause" or "brief pause" out loud</p>
				<p class="body-text text-sm">
					A participant reported that Ray was literally saying words like "pause" and "brief pause" instead of just pausing naturally like a human would. We've updated Ray's system prompt to fix this behaviour.

					Added a clearer explanation of what "digitally excluded" means during the onboarding phase, so participants understand the term before continuing.
