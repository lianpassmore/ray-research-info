				<p class="body-text text-sm">
					We realised that with Claude Haiku 4.5 we were going to run out of credits well before the two-week mark. To make sure everyone gets enough time with Ray, we've switched the underlying model to Gemini Flash 2.5, which gives us significantly more minutes. This may affect Ray's voice and performance at times — if you notice anything odd, please let the researcher know. Better to make this change now while the pilot is still early.

				<p class="font-bold mb-2">Fix: Ray no longer says "pause" or "brief pause" out loud</p>
				<p class="body-text text-sm">
					A participant reported that Ray was literally saying words like "pause" and "brief pause" instead of just pausing naturally like a human would. We've updated Ray's system prompt to fix this behaviour.
