				<p>When you consented to participate, you agreed to:</p>

					<li>Try Ray between February 12-26, 2026</li>
					<li>Give quick feedback after each session (~3 minutes)</li>
					<li>Complete a final reflection at the end (~15 minutes)</li>
					<li>Allow the researcher to analyse broad themes across all participants</li>

				<p class="mt-4">You understood that:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-sm">
					<li>Your conversations are private</li>
					<li>Ray is coaching, not therapy</li>
					<li>Ray can't help in a crisis</li>

			<h2 class="heading-lg mb-4">What Happens to Your Conversations</h2>
			<div class="space-y-4">
				<div class="glass-panel p-5 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-forest-green mb-4">
					<p class="font-bold text-sm mb-2">The researcher will NOT read your session transcripts.</p>
					<p class="text-sm">Your conversations with Ray are private. The researcher does not read through what you talked about.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="input-field bg-white/40">
					<p class="font-bold text-sm mb-1">So what happens to my transcripts?</p>
					<p class="text-sm">Transcripts are stored securely in ElevenLabs. Before any analysis, AI is used to strip out all personal details (names, places, identifying info). Each participant is then assigned a number — the researcher never sees your name attached to a transcript.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="input-field bg-white/40">
					<p class="font-bold text-sm mb-1">Is my voice data classified as biometric data?</p>
					<p class="text-sm">Under some laws, your voice data may be classified as biometric information. ElevenLabs uses this data solely for verification and voice modelling — never for profiling or targeting.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="input-field bg-white/40">
					<p class="font-bold text-sm mb-1">What kind of analysis is done?</p>
					<p class="text-sm">Only high-level aggregate analysis across all participants — broad themes, common topics, and patterns. The researcher is not reading or analysing your personal relationship content.</p>
				</div>

		<!-- Feedback & Reflections -->

			<div class="space-y-4">
				<div class="glass-panel p-5 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-clay">
					<p class="font-bold text-sm mb-2">Your feedback and reflections are different from your session transcripts.</p>
					<p class="text-sm">The researcher <strong>will</strong> read your post-session feedback and final reflections, and will know who submitted them. This is so the researcher can understand your experience of using Ray.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="input-field bg-white/40">
					<p class="font-bold text-sm mb-1">What if the researcher wants to quote me?</p>
					<p class="text-sm">If the researcher wants to use a quote from your reflections in the final findings, <strong>they will check with you first</strong>. Nothing is quoted without your permission, and all quotes are anonymised.</p>

					<p class="font-bold text-sm mb-1">Can I opt out of AI training?</p>

				<p>Your reflections about using Ray will help shape the final Master's project and answer whether conversational AI can be designed ethically for vulnerable interactions.</p>
				<p>The researcher will:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-sm">
					<li>Run high-level aggregate analysis on anonymised transcripts (themes, topics, patterns across all participants)</li>
					<li>Read your feedback and reflections to understand your experience</li>
					<li>Share anonymised findings in the final project (April 2026 submission)</li>
					<li>Return findings to you — you'll receive a summary of what was learned</li>
					<li>Present at academic conferences and potentially publish in journals (always anonymised)</li>
					<li>Check with you before quoting any of your reflections</li>
