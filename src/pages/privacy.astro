			<div class="body-text space-y-4">
				<p>When you consented to participate, you agreed to:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-sm">
					<li>Try Ray between February 12-26, 2026</li>
					<li>Give quick feedback after each session (~3 minutes)</li>
					<li>Complete a final reflection at the end (~15 minutes)</li>
					<li>Allow the researcher to analyse broad themes across all participants</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="mt-4">You understood that:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-sm">
					<li>Your conversations are private</li>
					<li>Ray is coaching, not therapy</li>
					<li>Ray can't help in a crisis</li>
					<li>Sessions cap at 45 minutes</li>
					<li>Each session starts fresh — Ray doesn't remember previous conversation content (but knows your profile context if you've shared it)</li>
					<li>You can withdraw before March 1, 2026</li>

		<!-- What Happens to Your Conversations -->
		<section>
			<h2 class="heading-lg mb-4">What Happens to Your Conversations</h2>
			<div class="space-y-4">
				<div class="glass-panel p-5 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-forest-green mb-4">
					<p class="font-bold text-sm mb-2">The researcher will NOT read your session transcripts.</p>
					<p class="text-sm">Your conversations with Ray are private. The researcher does not read through what you talked about.</p>
				</div>
				<details class="accordion-item input-field bg-white/40">
					<summary class="font-bold text-sm">So what happens to my transcripts?</summary>
					<p class="text-sm mt-2">Transcripts are stored securely in ElevenLabs. Before any analysis, AI is used to strip out all personal details (names, places, identifying info). Each participant is then assigned a number — the researcher never sees your name attached to a transcript.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="accordion-item input-field bg-white/40">
					<summary class="font-bold text-sm">Is my voice data classified as biometric data?</summary>
					<p class="text-sm mt-2">Under some laws, your voice data may be classified as biometric information. ElevenLabs uses this data solely for verification and voice modelling — never for profiling or targeting.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="accordion-item input-field bg-white/40">
					<summary class="font-bold text-sm">What kind of analysis is done?</summary>
					<p class="text-sm mt-2">Only high-level aggregate analysis across all participants — broad themes, common topics, and patterns. The researcher is not reading or analysing your personal relationship content.</p>
				</details>
			</div>
		</section>

		<!-- Your Profile Context -->
		<section>
			<h2 class="heading-lg mb-4">Your Profile Context ("Help Ray Know You")</h2>
			<div class="space-y-4">
				<div class="glass-panel p-5 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-forest-green mb-4">
					<p class="font-bold text-sm mb-2">This is profile data you choose to share — not a transcript, not AI-generated.</p>
					<p class="text-sm">It's the same category as your display name. You control what goes in, and you can change or delete it anytime.</p>
				</div>
				<details class="accordion-item input-field bg-white/40">
					<summary class="font-bold text-sm">What is it?</summary>
					<p class="text-sm mt-2">A form in the menu where you can optionally share context about yourself — relationship status, partner's name, children, occupation, living situation, or anything else you think would help. All fields are optional.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="accordion-item input-field bg-white/40">
					<summary class="font-bold text-sm">What does Ray do with it?</summary>
					<p class="text-sm mt-2">Ray receives your context at the start of each session so it doesn't have to ask you the basics every time. Ray also knows your session number, when your last session was, and how many days it's been — so it can pick up naturally.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="accordion-item input-field bg-white/40">
					<summary class="font-bold text-sm">Is this the same as Ray remembering conversations?</summary>
					<p class="text-sm mt-2">No. Ray still doesn't remember what you talked about. It only knows the context you've explicitly shared in your profile. Each conversation still starts fresh.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="accordion-item input-field bg-white/40">
					<summary class="font-bold text-sm">Can I change or delete it?</summary>
					<p class="text-sm mt-2">Yes. You can edit or clear your profile context anytime from the menu. If you delete it, Ray goes back to knowing nothing about you beyond your name.</p>
				</details>
			</div>
		</section>

		<!-- Feedback & Reflections -->
		<section>
			<h2 class="heading-lg mb-4">Feedback & Reflections</h2>
			<div class="space-y-4">
				<div class="glass-panel p-5 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-clay">
					<p class="font-bold text-sm mb-2">Your feedback and reflections are different from your session transcripts.</p>
					<p class="text-sm">The researcher <strong>will</strong> read your post-session feedback and final reflections, and will know who submitted them. This is so the researcher can understand your experience of using Ray.</p>
				</div>
				<details class="accordion-item input-field bg-white/40">
					<summary class="font-bold text-sm">What if the researcher wants to quote me?</summary>
					<p class="text-sm mt-2">If the researcher wants to use a quote from your reflections in the final findings, <strong>they will check with you first</strong>. Nothing is quoted without your permission, and all quotes are anonymised.</p>

				</details>
				<details class="accordion-item input-field bg-white/40">
					<summary class="font-bold text-sm">Can I delete my data?</summary>

					<summary class="font-bold text-sm">Can I withdraw?</summary>

				</details>
				<details class="accordion-item input-field bg-white/40">
					<summary class="font-bold text-sm">Can I opt out of AI training?</summary>
					<p class="text-sm mt-2">Yes. You can prevent ElevenLabs from using your voice data to train their AI models. This doesn't affect Ray's research use.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="accordion-item input-field bg-white/40">
