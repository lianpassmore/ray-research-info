		<section>
			<h1 class="heading-xl mb-4">The Research</h1>
			<p class="body-text">
				This Master's research asks: <em class="italic text-clay">can AI be designed ethically for vulnerable conversations?</em>
			</p>
			<p class="body-text mt-3">
				Relationships are one of the most vulnerable contexts we navigate. If AI can be built well for this, those principles can apply anywhere.

		<!-- What's Being Studied -->
		<section>
			<h2 class="heading-lg mb-4">What's Being Studied</h2>
			<div class="body-text space-y-3">
				<p>The researcher is studying your <em>experience</em> of using Ray:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-sm mt-3">
					<li>Did it feel respectful, safe, and helpful?</li>
					<li>What worked and what didn't?</li>
					<li>How did the lack of memory between sessions feel?</li>
					<li>Did the cultural values come through in how Ray interacted with you?</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="glass-panel p-4 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-forest-green mt-4">
					<p class="text-sm font-bold">The researcher will NOT read your session transcripts.</p>
					<p class="text-sm mt-1">Transcripts are anonymised by AI (personal details removed) and assigned a participant number. Only high-level aggregate analysis is done — themes, topics, and patterns across all participants. What you talked about with Ray stays private.</p>

		<!-- Research Questions -->
		<section>
			<h2 class="heading-lg mb-6">Research Questions</h2>
			<p class="body-text mb-6">This pilot helps answer five questions for the final Master's project:</p>
			<div class="space-y-6">
				<div class="glass-panel p-5 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-charcoal">
					<p class="font-bold text-clay mb-1">1. Kei raro (Foundations)</p>
					<p class="text-sm mb-2">What barriers silence voices in current feedback systems?</p>
					<p class="text-xs text-warm-grey italic">For Ray: Can conversational AI lower barriers that keep people from seeking relationship support?</p>

					<p class="text-sm mb-2">How can AI technology be developed ethically?</p>
					<p class="text-xs text-warm-grey italic">For Ray: What does ethical development look like when AI is handling our most vulnerable conversations?</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="body-text mt-6">Your experience using Ray directly answers these questions.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- Cultural Foundations -->
		<section>
			<h2 class="heading-lg mb-6">Cultural Foundations</h2>
			<p class="body-text mb-4">Ray is grounded in three core values from Māori and Pasifika worldviews:</p>
			<div class="space-y-4">
				<div class="glass-panel p-5 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-clay">
					<span class="font-bold text-clay block">Vā</span>
					<span class="text-sm">The sacred relational space between people.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="glass-panel p-5 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-clay">
					<span class="font-bold text-clay block">Utu Tūturu</span>
					<span class="text-sm">Enduring collective reciprocity.</span>
				</div>
				<div class="glass-panel p-5 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-clay">
					<span class="font-bold text-clay block">Mana Motuhake</span>
					<span class="text-sm">Absolute data sovereignty.</span>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="body-text mt-4 font-semibold">These aren't decorative concepts. They're built into how Ray thinks, responds, and holds space for vulnerable conversations.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- What Happens After the Pilot -->
		<section>
			<h2 class="heading-lg mb-4">What Happens After the Pilot?</h2>
			<div class="body-text space-y-4">
				<p><strong>This pilot is primarily a research case study for the final Master's project.</strong> Your participation helps determine whether conversational AI can be designed ethically for vulnerable contexts.</p>
				<p><strong>However — if Ray works well, it may become publicly available.</strong></p>
				<p>That means:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-sm">
					<li>If Ray proves to be <strong>safe</strong> (crisis protocols work, no harm caused)</li>
					<li>If Ray proves to be <strong>helpful</strong> (people find it genuinely useful)</li>
					<li>If Ray proves to be <strong>culturally grounded</strong> (values aren't just decorative)</li>
					<li>If Ray passes all <strong>safety and ethical audits</strong></li>
				</ul>
				<p>...then Ray may launch as a subscription service in the App Store and Play Store so others can access it.</p>

				<div class="glass-panel p-5 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-forest-green mt-4">
					<p class="label-sm text-forest-green mb-2">To be clear</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-4 space-y-2 text-sm">
						<li>Right now, this is research</li>
						<li>You're helping test whether this <em>should</em> exist</li>
						<li>Your feedback determines whether Ray ever becomes a public product</li>
						<li>If it does launch, your participation in this pilot won't obligate you to anything</li>
						<li>Any future version would honour the same data sovereignty principles</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p class="mt-4"><strong>Why this transparency matters:</strong> This isn't just a report that gets shelved. If Ray is built well and proven safe, it's designed to help people navigate relationships with more clarity and confidence. Your voice in this pilot shapes whether that happens and how.</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<!-- Honouring the Space -->
		<section class="border-t border-charcoal/10 pt-10">
			<h2 class="heading-lg mb-4">Honouring the Space</h2>
			<div class="body-text space-y-4">
				<p>Relationship conversations touch on things that sit close to the heart — emotions, identity, whānau, mana. For some people, this kind of kōrero naturally sits in a tapu-adjacent space. Using an AI tool for these conversations might feel unfamiliar or uncomfortable, and that's completely valid.</p>
				<p>If it feels right for you, you're welcome to open or close your sessions in whatever way honours that space — whether that's a karakia, a moment of quiet reflection, a deep breath, or simply checking in with yourself before and after. There's no right or wrong way to do this. Ray is designed to hold space respectfully, and how you enter and leave that space is entirely yours.</p>
